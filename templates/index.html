          Hello and welcome to Community Books! This site was created to allow
          users to share your favorite pieces of literature with the world. By
          clicking the button below you will be brought to our library where you
          can view previously submitted books. You then have the option to edit
          any entry should you see an error or simply not think the book is of
          the best quality. Using the menu you can submit your book using the
          "Add A New Book" function. Enjoy the site!
